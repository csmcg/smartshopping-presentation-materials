# smartshopping-presentation-materials

This is a repository which holds presentation materials for Team 5 of the Spring 2020 UAB Electring Engineering EE499 Senior Design class. It includes the final report which documents the design process over EE498 as well as the implementation details, choices, challenges, etc. from EE499.

Additionally, a PDF of the PowerPoint slides for the final presentation to the department is included. Since this presentation was done remotely over screenshare and not live and in person, there are two companion videos that were played during the presentation which can also be found in this repo. One details the software implementation on the Raspberry Pi and the Node.js w/ Express.js server, while the other dives into our pathfinding application to guide shoppers to the products they require in a physical environment.

The following repositories hold the software implemented for this project:

[SmartShopping RaspberryPi (Client) Repo](https://www.github.com/csmcg/smartshopping-pi)

[SmartShopping Backend (Server) Repo](https://www.github.com/csmcg/smartshopping-srvr)

Please note that at the time of writing (6/23/2020) the project is simply in a state for demonstration of key design concepts, and does not constitute a finished product.
